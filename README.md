# Peg SoliShare
## Idea
In Peg SoliShare, players can play Peg Solitaire puzzles created by other players around the world, or create and share their own puzzles with the world.
## Inspiration
- Peg Solitaire and its sub-puzzles: "Disappearing Act" puzzle series from Professor Layton and Pandora's Box / the Diabolical Box
- User-generated level platform: Super Mario Maker series
- Name of solvable puzzle cache (Sacred Timeline): Loki (TV series)

## To-Do
- Finish generating Sacred Timeline
- Puzzle-creation UI similar to normal gameplay, only balls are either placed manually or generated from reverse-moves; after which it can be uploaded (after being verified as solvable of course)
- After all of the above is done: online functionality ("Course World"); create and upload, or browse and play (rating system? keep track of high scores?)
